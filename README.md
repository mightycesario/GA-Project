# Star Wars Planets SWAPI

## Motivation

I have always liked the star wars universe so I chose to work with the Star wars API
"SWAPI". With all of the latest editions to the Star Wars universe whether its the latest episodes realeased in theatres or the latest creations on Disney plus streaming services like all the craze about The Mandalorian, I feel like you cant go wrong with lightsabers , life lessons, maybe politics? and the force! Its just overall great entertainment and fun.

## Credits

I Would like to thank the Instructors and Co-Instructors as well as all of the awesome 
T.A.'s that help with before and after hours lessons, it's invaluable. All of this assistance was instrumental on getting me through the development and getting code and functions to work properly. Especially those who assisted me with my annoying timer functions, thanks a bunch and I still know I need to get a better grasp on those two code concepts they are tricky for sure.


## Future development

I would like to add some more content to this and adjust some of the layout as well as getting more images for some kind of a randomizing feature someting to have it look less static have a more dynamic feel.
